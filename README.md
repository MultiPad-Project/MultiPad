# MultiPad
This project is inspired by Unipad by <a href="https://github.com/kimjisub/">Kimjisub</a>

## But why?
There are many things that I would like in Unipad but that wasn't up to me, so when creating MultiPad I thought of putting in everything that was possible, in addition to other users' wishes.

## What's different?
In addition to the basic functions of Unipad, MultiPad has:
 - change skins in real time (Instant).
 - 10x10 mode: Pro mode - Standard.
 - 9x9 mode: MK2 mode - Secondary.
 > (Other layouts like 10x8 from Unipad and 8x8 from Matrix will be implemented).
 - Autoplay progress bar  to interact: To manipulate state like fast forward and fast backward.
 - Customization of LEDs: Custom color table. By default the MultiPad has the color table of EyeDrop (Default) and Unipad.
 - Led Spam: The same led will not stop if touched again. It might be slow.
 - Sound Spam: The same sound will not stop if played again. It might be slow.
 - Glow: Imitation of real light glow.
 - Slide: Drag over the buttons.
 - Decoration: Possibility to use, for example, an overlay launchpad PNG - There will be an example in the future.
